Project in cybersecurity (specifically insider threats).
Program crunches millions of data points regarding employee activity, into a format conducive for "Hidden Markov" analysis.
The "test" files are abridged versions of the full csv files. Each contains a log of a distinct activity across all employees in chronological order. The program reads through the files and creates an arraylist of objects sorted by user with all of his/her activities. Each "activity" object contains features of the activity that can be represented by a predetermined integer. The output csv files consist of these integers.
